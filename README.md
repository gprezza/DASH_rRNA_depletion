# DASH_rRNA_depletion
Python tool to design sgRNA pools targeting the rRNA genes.

## Dependencies
These Python (3.x) packages are required to run th the script:

* Bio
* gffutils
* primer3-py

You'll also need to have [Bowtie](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/index.shtml) installed.

## Usage
```
Designs a pool of sgRNAs targeting the ribosomal genes of a bacterial species.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --minGC MINGC, -g MINGC
                        Minimal accepted GC% of a spacer (Default: 30).
  --maxGC MAXGC, -G MAXGC
                        Maximal accepted GC% of a spacer (Default: 80).
  --length LENGTH, -l LENGTH
                        Spacer length (Default: 20).
  --offtargets, -o      Print the spacers that were discarded because of off-
                        targeting.
  --manual_ann MANUAL_ANN, -ma MANUAL_ANN
                        Use if you want to provide a file with the manual
                        annotation (in bed format) of the rRNA genes (Default:
                        False).
  --pam PAM, -p PAM     PAM sequence (Default: NGG).
```

The working directory must have the design_grnas.py file and the subfolders **reference_sequences/** and **bowtie_files/**. If a gff annotation of the transcriptome is available, you'll also need a **annotations/** folder.

* Copy the fasta sequences of the chromosome and plasmids (if any) in the reference_sequences/ folder. 

* If you already have bowtie indexes of these sequences, copy them into bowtie_files/, otherwise they will be generated by the script.

* If you want to use a gff annotation, copy the file(s) in the annotations/ folder.

* If you don't want to use a gff annotation, provide the coordinates of the rRNA genes **in BED format** through the -manual_ann argument.

### Output
The following files are generated by the script:
* oligos.csv: file with the sequences of the oligos that have to be ordered to generate the pool.
* grnas.fa: multifasta file with all the spacers selected by the script.
* bowtie.csv: output file of Bowtie (to have a look at oligos discarded for off-targeting).
